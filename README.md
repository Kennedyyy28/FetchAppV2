#README
#This application is a native Android app in Java designed for Fetch Rewards. The application reads a JSON, deserializes it, and sorts it by item id and name. 
#All objects with a value of null or that contain an empty string are not displayed to the user. The data is displayed in an easy to read list after
#pressing the "Let's go!' button on the launcher page.

#Please note- the local.properties file was added after the initial commit through Android Studio. It was added after noticing it was not in this repository. 
#If there are any troubles, this file may not be needed.
